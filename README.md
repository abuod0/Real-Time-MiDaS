<h1>PyTorch Python Implementation of MiDaS for Real-Time Relative Depth Prediction</h1>
<p>This repository contains the PyTorch Python implementation of MiDaS for real-time relative depth prediction. Relative depth prediction, in general, provides more accurate depth prediction in various scene types by forgoing absolute depth scale, compared to absolute depth prediction (e.g., monodepth).</p>
<p>The implementation is especially useful for researchers who are working on robotics problems. Tested on Ubuntu 18.04 with an Intel i7 processor and an CPU and can be used with 'CUDA'.</p>
